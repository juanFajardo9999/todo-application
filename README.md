# Enterprise-Ready Todo Application

## Overview

This project is a scalable, maintainable, and enterprise-ready Todo application built with modern web technologies. The application allows users to manage tasks efficiently with features such as creating, editing, deleting, and organizing tasks by their status.

## Architecture and Technology Choices

### 1. React 18
- Utilizes hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) for state management and side effects.
- Implements lazy loading using `React.lazy` for performance optimization.

### 2. Redux Toolkit
- Simplifies global state management with slices.
- Provides a scalable architecture for managing complex application states.

### 3. TypeScript
- Enforces type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving developer productivity.
- Supports better maintainability through static typing and improved code readability.

### 4. Material-UI
- Provides a responsive, accessible, and cohesive design system with prebuilt components.
- Speeds up UI development and ensures a professional look and feel.

### 5. json-server
- Mocks a REST API for rapid development and testing without requiring a full backend.

## Enterprise Readiness

### Scalability
- Modular folder structure ensures features can be extended without affecting existing functionality.
- Redux Toolkit effectively manages complex application states, supporting larger datasets and user bases.

### Performance
- Memoization (`React.memo`, `useMemo`) prevents unnecessary renders, improving UI responsiveness.
- Virtualized lists (e.g., `react-window`) efficiently handle large datasets.

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns between components, features, and state management.
- Reusable components and a feature-based folder structure enhance maintainability.

### Security
- Input validation and sanitization prevent XSS and other vulnerabilities.
- Adheres to best practices for secure data handling and storage.

### Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling using global Error Boundaries.
- User-friendly feedback for failed operations (e.g., API errors).
